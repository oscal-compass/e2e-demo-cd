            "value": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as `telnet`, `ftp`, `rlogin`, `rsh`, and `rcp`. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec. Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are `addr`, `user`, `host`, `laddr`, `lport`, and `rdomain` and correspond to source address, user, resolved source host name, local address, local port number and routing domain respectively.",

            "value": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as `telnet`, `ftp`, `rlogin`, `rsh`, and `rcp`. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec. Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are `addr`, `user`, `host`, `laddr`, `lport`, and `rdomain` and correspond to source address, user, resolved source host name, local address, local port number and routing domain respectively.",

It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria.

The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec.

Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode.

Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec.

It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address.

            "value": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as `telnet`, `ftp`, `rlogin`, `rsh`, and `rcp`. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec. Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list.

            "value": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as `telnet`, `ftp`, `rlogin`, `rsh`, and `rcp`. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec.

It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec.

            "value": "Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as `telnet`, `ftp`, `rlogin`, `rsh`, and `rcp`. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.  The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, **if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped**.  `sshd_config`: - The openSSH daemon configuration directives, `Include` and `Match`, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section. - The default `Include` location is the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory. This default has been accounted for in this section. If a file has an additional `Include` that isn't this default location, the files should be reviewed to verify that the recommended setting is not being over-ridden. - The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a `Match` block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non-matching substitution. - `Include`:  - Include the specified configuration file(s).  - Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.  - Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in `/etc/ssh/`.  - An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion. - `Match`:  - Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.  - The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.  - The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the PATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).  - The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for the address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, `192.0.2.0/33` and `192.0.2.0/8`, respectively.  - Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page. - Once all configuration changes have been made to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` or any included configuration files, the `sshd` configuration must be reloaded  Command to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:  ``` # systemctl reload-or-restart sshd ```  `sshd` command: - `-T` - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more `-C` options. - `-C` - connection_spec. Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple `-C` options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are `addr`, `user`, `host`, `laddr`, `lport`, and `rdomain` and correspond to source address, user, resolved source host name, local address, local port number and routing domain respectively.",

Options: - `<dir=/path/to/tally-directory>` - The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock. Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory. - `audit` - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found. - `silent` - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users. - `no_log_info` - Don't log informative messages via syslog(3). - `local_users_only` - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism. - `nodelay` - Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures. - `deny=<n>` - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds _<n>_. The default is 3. - `fail_interval=n` - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes). - `unlock_time=n` - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers. - `even_deny_root` - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts. - `root_unlock_time=n` - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option. - `admin_group=name` - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set.",

Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory. - `audit` - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found. - `silent` - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users. - `no_log_info` - Don't log informative messages via syslog(3). - `local_users_only` - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts. Enabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism. - `nodelay` - Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures. - `deny=<n>` - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds _<n>_. The default is 3. - `fail_interval=n` - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15 minutes). - `unlock_time=n` - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes). Note that the default directory that pam_faillock uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be also re-enabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers. - `even_deny_root` - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts. - `root_unlock_time=n` - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option. - `admin_group=name` - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set.",

If that is undesirable a different tally directory must be set with the dir option. Also note that it is usually undesirable to permanently lock out users as they can become easily a target of denial of service attack unless the usernames are random and kept secret to potential attackers. - `even_deny_root` - Root account can become locked as well as regular accounts. - `root_unlock_time=n` - This option implies even_deny_root option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after the account is locked. In case the option is not specified the value is the same as of the unlock_time option. - `admin_group=name` - If a group name is specified with this option, members of the group will be handled by this module the same as the root account (the options even_deny_root and root_unlock_time will apply to them. By default the option is not set.",

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.",

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.",

It places an extra burden on users and many will use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a “special character” at the end).

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.",

It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password.

If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0.

Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file.

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file.

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.",

            "value": "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.  These checks are configurable by either: - use of the module arguments - modifying the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file - creating a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  **Note:** The module arguments override the settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file. Settings in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` configuration file override settings in a `.conf` file in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/` directory.  The possible options in the file are: - `difok` - Number of characters in the new password that must not be present in the old password. (default 1). The special value of 0 disables all checks of similarity of the new password with the old password except the new password being exactly the same as the old one. - `minlen` - Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_pwquality(8).) Cannot be set to lower value than 6. (default 8) - `dcredit` - The maximum credit for having digits in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of digits in the new password. (default 0) - `ucredit` - The maximum credit for having uppercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of uppercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `lcredit` - The maximum credit for having lowercase characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of lowercase characters in the new password. (default 0) - `ocredit` - The maximum credit for having other characters in the new password. If less than 0 it is the minimum number of other characters in the new password. (default 0) - `minclass` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others). (default 0) - `maxrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxsequence` - The maximum length of monotonic character sequences in the new password. Examples of such sequence are '12345' or 'fedcb'. Note that most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `maxclassrepeat` - The maximum number of allowed consecutive characters of the same class in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `gecoscheck` - If nonzero, check whether the words longer than 3 characters from the GECOS field of the user's passwd(5) entry are contained in the new password. The check is disabled if the value is 0. (default 0) - `dictcheck` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) matches a word in a dictionary. Currently the dictionary check is performed using the cracklib library. (default 1) - `usercheck=<N>` - If nonzero, check whether the password (with possible modifications) contains the user name in some form. It is not performed for user names shorter than 3 characters. (default 1) - `usersubstr=<N>` - If greater than 3 (due to the minimum length in usercheck), check whether the password contains a substring of at least N length in some form. (default 0) - `enforcing=<N>` - If nonzero, reject the password if it fails the checks, otherwise only print the warning. This setting applies only to the pam_pwquality module and possibly other applications that explicitly change their behavior based on it. It does not affect pwmake(1) and pwscore(1). (default 1) - `badwords` - Space separated list of words that must not be contained in the password. These are additional words to the cracklib dictionary check. This setting can be also used by applications to emulate the gecos check for user accounts that are not created yet. - `dictpath` - Path to the cracklib dictionaries. Default is to use the cracklib default. - `retry=<N>` - Prompt user at most N times before returning with error. The default is 1. - `enforce_for_root` - The module will return error on failed check even if the user changing the password is root. This option is off by default which means that just the message about the failed check is printed but root can change the password anyway. Note that root is not asked for an old password so the checks that compare the old and new password are not performed. - `local_users_only` - The module will not test the password quality for users that are not present in the /etc/passwd file. The module still asks for the password so the following modules in the stack can use the use_authtok option. This option is off by default.",

Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.",

In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to: - Indication of compromise - Change of user roles - When a user leaves the organization.  Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but it’s also been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password.",

The `umask` modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The `umask` is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the `umask` are cleared in the resulting file mode.  `umask` can be set with either `Octal` or `Symbolic` values: - `Octal` (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie `umask 0027` or `umask 027`. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - `Symbolic` Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User `u`, group `g`, and world/other `o`. The permissions listed are not masked by `umask`. ie a `umask` set by `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` is the `Symbolic` equivalent of the `Octal` `umask 027`. This `umask` would set a newly created directory with file mode `drwxr-x---` and a newly created file with file mode `rw-r-----`.  **root user Shell Configuration Files:** - `/root/.bash_profile` - Is executed to configure the root users' shell before the initial command prompt. **Is only read by login shells.** - `/root/.bashrc` - Is executed for interactive shells. **only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login**  `umask` is set by order of precedence. If `umask` is set in multiple locations, this order of precedence will determine the system's default `umask`.  **Order of precedence:** 1. `/root/.bash_profile` 2. `/root/.bashrc` 3.

            "value": "The user file-creation mode mask (`umask`) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (`rwxrwxrwx`), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (`rw-rw-rw-`). The `umask` modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The `umask` is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the `umask` are cleared in the resulting file mode.  `umask` can be set with either `Octal` or `Symbolic` values: - `Octal` (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie `umask 0027` or `umask 027`. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - `Symbolic` Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User `u`, group `g`, and world/other `o`. The permissions listed are not masked by `umask`. ie a `umask` set by `umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=` is the `Symbolic` equivalent of the `Octal` `umask 027`. This `umask` would set a newly created directory with file mode `drwxr-x---` and a newly created file with file mode `rw-r-----`.  The default `umask` can be set to use the `pam_umask` module or in a `System Wide Shell Configuration File`. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default `umask` by adding the `umask` command into a `User Shell Configuration File`, ( `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`), in their home directory.  **Setting the default umask:** - pam_umask module:  - will set the umask according to the system default in `/etc/login.defs` and user settings, solving the problem of different `umask` settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.  - `umask=<mask>` value in the `/etc/login.defs` file is interpreted as Octal  - Setting `USERGROUPS_ENAB` to yes in `/etc/login.defs` (default):  - will enable setting of the `umask` group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the `uid` is the same as `gid`, and `username` is the same as the `<primary group name>`  - userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user - `System Wide Shell Configuration File`:  - `/etc/profile` - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the `.bash_profile`, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. **is only executed for interactive *login* shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter.**   - `/etc/profile.d` - `/etc/profile` will execute the scripts within `/etc/profile.d/*.sh`. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within `/etc/profile.d` to set your own system wide environmental variables.  - `/etc/bashrc` - System wide version of `.bashrc`. In Fedora derived distributions, `etc/bashrc` also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if *non-login* shell, but redirects output to `/dev/null` if *non-interactive.* **Is only executed for *interactive* shells or if `BASH_ENV` is set to `/etc/bashrc`.**  **User Shell Configuration Files:** - `~/.bash_profile` - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. **Is only read by login shells.** - `~/.bashrc` - Is executed for interactive shells. **only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login**  `umask` is set by order of precedence. If `umask` is set in multiple locations, this order of precedence will determine the system's default `umask`.  **Order of precedence:** 1. A file in `/etc/profile.d/` ending in `.sh` - This will override any other system-wide `umask` setting 2. In the file `/etc/profile` 3. On the `pam_umask.so` module in `/etc/pam.d/postlogin` 4. In the file `/etc/login.defs` 5. In the file `/etc/default/login`",
